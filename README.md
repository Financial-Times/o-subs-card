## Usage
_Whatever usage instructions your component has. We've broken this down by Markup, JavaScript and Sass, but it depends how complex your component is._

### Markup

_Common templating can go here, especially if there is only one template, but people can always check the demos for more._

_Remember to start your codeblocks with three backticks and "html" so your markup is syntax highlighted correctly._

```html
<div data-o-component="o-component-boilerplate" class='o-component-boilerplate'>
</div>
```

### JavaScript
_Remember to start your codeblocks with three backticks and "js" so your js is syntax highlighted correctly._

_Though it's not practical to repeat every aspect of Origami modules convention for every component, **A LOT** of people get tripped up by modules not auto initialising, so this line (remember to change the `o-component-boilerplate` to your component name) is useful if you have JavaScript:_

No code will run automatically unless you are using the Build Service.
You must either construct an `o-component-boilerplate` object or fire the `o.DOMContentLoaded` event, which oComponent listens for.

#### Constructing an o-component-boilerplate

```js
const oComponentBoilerplate = require('o-component-boilerplate');

const oComponentBoilerplate = new oComponentBoilerplate();
```

#### Firing an oDomContentLoaded event

```js
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
	document.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('o.DOMContentLoaded'));
});
```

### Sass
_Remember to start your codeblocks with three backticks and "sass" so your markup is syntax highlighted correctly._

_Though it's not practical to repeat every aspect of Origami modules convention for every component, **A LOT** of people get tripped up by silent mode, so this line (remember to change the o-component-boilerplate to your component name) is useful if you have Sass:_

As with all Origami components, o-component-boilerplate has a [silent mode](http://origami.ft.com/docs/syntax/scss/#silent-styles). To use its compiled CSS (rather than using its mixins with your own Sass) set `$o-component-boilerplate-is-silent : false;` in your Sass before you import the o-component-boilerplate Sass.

## Troubleshooting
_This is a good place to put problems that come up repeatedly_

### The thing with the thing isn't working
Fix it by turning it off and on again

## Contributing
If your component is particularly complicated (image sets fall into this category) then a contributing section or even a contributing.md might be useful.


## Migration guide
_Migration guides are very important! Always include one for major releases. To create a codeblock that has diff highligting, use three backticks followed by the word diff_

### Migrating from 1.X.X to 2.X.X

The 2.0.0 release changes the default behaviour of o-component-boilerplate.

```diff
<div class="o-component-boilerplate__container">
- remove this line
+ add this line
</div>
```
